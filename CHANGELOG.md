#### Version 1.3 (20th January 2012)

    values in project file can be overridden). It is needed to specify
    custom build options to make in-app unit tests work.

#### Version 1.2.2 (19th December 2011)

    using a relative path for its FS Root directory (JENKINS-12144)

#### Version 1.2.1 (18th December 2011)

-   Fix : Build IPA switch doesn't work properly for a default Xcode
    project always results in FATAL error (JENKINS-12089)

#### Version 1.2 (8th December 2011)

-   New build parameter to specify the build output directory. This
    overrides the setting in the user's project file, so it will be put
    into a known directory rather than XcodeDerivedData, etc. This makes
    it much easier to set up subsequent build steps in Jenkins that do
    something with the output of the build. It does this by passing the
    setting CONFIGURATION\_BUILD\_DIR to xcodebuild if a path is set for
    this new job config value.
-   Add support for building schemes and workspaces : The plugin now
    supports two extra configuration parameters `xcodeScheme` and
    `xcodeWorkspaceFile`. The scheme maps to xcodebuild's parameter
    "-scheme" and the workspace to "-workspace". The scheme takes
    precedence over the target setting and the workspace takes
    precedence over the project setting.

#### Version 1.1 (29th November 2011)

-   Upgrade the token macro plugin to version 1.5.1 to support
    environment and build variables (JENKINS-11892)
-   New configuration parameter to set the SYMROOT value passed to the
    build. This parameter accepts environment and build variables and
    Macros (JENKINS-11813)
-   Various code cleanup and improvements.

#### Version 1.0.1 (14th November 2011)

-   Minor fix about the default value and the documentation of the
    keystore path parameter.

#### Version 1.0 (14th November 2011)

-   Initiated from [Ray Yamamoto Hilton's Xcode plugin for
    Hudson](http://rayh.com.au/xcode-hudson-plugin) with few changes :
    -   It improves jenkins compatibility, and is available in its
        update center.
    -   It uses the to configure values of `CFBundleVersion` and
        `CFBundleShortVersionString`
    -   It allows to configure the keychain to use and to unlock it
    -   It is ready for internationalization

If you previously used the version provided by Ray you should be able to
test this one in parallel as it has a new identity. Also you'll have to
reconfigure a large part of it if you want to upgrade thus don't forget
to save your settings.
